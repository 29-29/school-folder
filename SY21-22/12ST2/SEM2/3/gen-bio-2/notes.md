# Female Reproductive System

## The Uterus (Womb)
- The uterus is a hollow, muscular, pear-shaped organ about the size of a woman's clenched fist.
- The top is tipped forward in a normal 'anteflexion' position.
- It can be divided into the body or corpus, and the bottom cervix.
- The rounded top portion, above the fallopian tubes, is called the fundus.
- The uterus is supported and held in position by a number of ligaments.
- Trauma, disease, or multiple pregnancies can weaken these ligaments and result in abnormal positioning.
- The cervical opening is about the diameter of a pencil.

### 3 Uterus Functions
1. The endometrium sheds the lining of the uterus every 21 to 40 days by menstruation.
2. It provides a place for the protection and nourishment of the fetus during pregnancy.
3. It contracts during labor to expel the fetus.

### Uterus Wall
- Has 3 layers:
	1. **Perimetrium** (Outside Layer)
	2. **Myometrium** (Muscular Inside)
	3. **Endometrium** (Mucous Membrane Lining)

## Fallopian Tubes
- Tube widens to form the **ampulla** */AM-pyu-lah/*.
- The **isthmus** is the portion that connects to uterus.
- **Fimbria** */FIHM-bree-ah/* are the finger-like projections around the opening that trap the egg as it leaves the ovary.
- End of the tube is called the **infundibulum** */in-fun-DIB-yu-lum/*.
- Opening is called the **ostium** */AH-ste-um/*.

### Endometriosis
- disorder
- some tissues grow outside the uterus.

### Dysmenorrhea
- blood won't release

## Myths Busted
1. Drink soda during dysmenorrhea
	- don't because you're just adding acid to the bloodflow
2. Give dark chocolate to women with period
	- don't because you're just increasing the duration of period cramps.
