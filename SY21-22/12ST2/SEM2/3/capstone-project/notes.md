# Capstone Project

## Traditional Research vs Capstone Research
- TR is more complicated; CR is simpler.
- TR requires more time and technical skills than CR.
- TR is for professional researchers; CR are for students.

## Purpose of Capstone Paper
- Overview of a complex subject
- Well-grounded
- Role: Convince the reader to accept your view/findings
- It serves as reality check of certain issues

## Components of a Capstone Paper
1. Introduction
2. Literature Review
3. Method
4. Results and Analysis
5. Conclusions/Discussion

## Identifying a Need
- Engineers themselves often do not do this step of the process, but rather society discovers a need and then presents that need to the engineering firm/community.
- The term "need" is fairly vague, but often refers to desire or shortage of a good.
- This "need" can sometimes be considered a necessity to some people but a luxury for others.
- Dealing with \_\_\_ is almost impossible.
- I wish there was a \_\_\_ to help.
- I need a \_\_\_ to get \_\_\_ done.

What is the scope of "need"?
- Local
- Global

## Defining the Problem
- Engineers must appropriately define the problem first in order to find an acceptable solution to it or improve it.
- What is the first step in "defining a problem"?
- Identify client (or customer)
- Confer extensively with the client about the problem
- The key is to listen
- Don't be afraid to go back and ask the client questions

### Questions that will help us get a better grasp on the problem
- What has been written about it?
- Is something already on the market that may solve the problem?
- What is wrong with the way it is being done?
- What is right with the way it is being done?
- Who manufactures the current 'solution'?
- How much does it cost? Will people pay for a better one if it cost more?
- Will people pay for a better one if it cost more?
- How much will they pay (or how bad is the problem)?

## Narrowing the Research
- The problem research and definition has been kept broad to allow for a large amount of possible solutions.
- Constraints are necessary because they eliminate any extreme solutions that would be inefficient, costly, and physically impossible to create.
