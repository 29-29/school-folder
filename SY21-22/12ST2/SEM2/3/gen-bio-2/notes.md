# Reproductive System

## What is the Reproductive System?
- The reproductive systems in both the male and female consist of primary and secondary sex organs and sex glands.
- The primary function of the reproductive systems is to perpetuate the species through sexual or germ cell fertilization and reproduction.

# Female Reproductive System

## The Uterus (Womb)
- The uterus is a hollow, muscular, pear-shaped organ about the size of a woman's clenched fist.
- The top is tipped forward in a normal 'anteflexion' position.
- It can be divided into the body or corpus, and the bottom cervix.
- The rounded top portion, above the fallopian tubes, is called the fundus.
- The uterus is supported and held in position by a number of ligaments.
- Trauma, disease, or multiple pregnancies can weaken these ligaments and result in abnormal positioning.
- The cervical opening is about the diameter of a pencil.

### 3 Uterus Functions
1. The endometrium sheds the lining of the uterus every 21 to 40 days by menstruation.
2. It provides a place for the protection and nourishment of the fetus during pregnancy.
3. It contracts during labor to expel the fetus.

### Uterus Wall
- Has 3 layers:
	1. **Perimetrium** (Outside Layer)
	2. **Myometrium** (Muscular Inside)
	3. **Endometrium** (Mucous Membrane Lining)

## Fallopian Tubes
- Tube widens to form the **ampulla** */AM-pyu-lah/*.
- The **isthmus** is the portion that connects to uterus.
- **Fimbria** */FIHM-bree-ah/* are the finger-like projections around the opening that trap the egg as it leaves the ovary.
- End of the tube is called the **infundibulum** */in-fun-DIB-yu-lum/*.
- Opening is called the **ostium** */AH-ste-um/*.

The fallopian tube is 4-6 inches long. The egg, released from the ovary, is captured by the fimbria and brought into the fallopian tube. The egg is moved along inside the tube by muscular contractions and the waving action of cilia. It takes an egg about 3-4 days to travel the length of the tube. If an egg is fertilized, it occurs here.

### Endometriosis
- disorder
- some tissues grow outside the uterus.

### Dysmenorrhea
- blood won't release

## Myths Busted
1. Drink soda during dysmenorrhea
	- don't because you're just adding acid to the bloodflow
2. Give dark chocolate to women with period
	- don't because you're just increasing the duration of period cramps.

## The Ovaries

The two ovaries are attached to each side of the uterus by a ligament. They are oval-shaped, about the size of a large olive, and lie close to the fimbria at the end of the fallopian tubes.

Each ovary is filled, already at birth, with egg-containing sacs called **follicles**. Each egg is called an **ovum**. Produces mature eggs and female sex hormones (*estrogen* and *progesterone*).

## The Ovaries and Ova

Once every 21 days, one follicle in one ovary ripens. This mature follice is a **graafian** */GRAW-fee-un/* follicle. The follicle ruptures in response to hormones from the pituitary gland, releasing the second oocyte ... a process called ovulation.

After the follicle ruptures, it becomes a mass of yellow cells called the corpus luteum. This is a temporary, progesterone-producing structure.

## The Vagina

The **vagina** extends from the uterus to the outside of the body. It is a 3.5 inch long muscular tube that expands in length and width during sexual arousal.

The vagina is the female organ for copulation (sexual intercourse), receiving the seminal fluid from the male penis. It is also a passageway for menstruation or the birth of a fetus.

## The Vulva

The vulva is 5 organs making up the external genitalia of the female:
1. ### Mons Pubis
	- Triangular shaped pad of fatty tissue over the pubis bone, covered in pubic hair
2. ### Labia Majora
	- 2 large fold of adipose tissue on the sides of the vaginal opening
3. ### Labia Minora
	- 2 smaller folds of adipose tissue on the inside of the labia majora
4. ### Vestibule
	- are between labia with openings for the vagina, urethra, and two excretory ducts for **Bartholin's glands** (provide lubricant)
5. ### Clitoris
	- sensitive fold of tissue partially covered by hood

The **perineum** is the area located between the vaginal opening and the anus. It is a muscular sheet that can be torn during childbirth.

Some doctors avoid uncontrolled tearing of the perineum by making a surgical incision called **episiotomy**.

## The Breasts

The breasts are the mammary glands, varying in size according to age, heredity, and the amount of fatty tissue present. Each breast has 15-20 **glandular lobes** separated by connective tissue. After childbirth, the pituitary gland stimulates these lobules with the hormone **prolactin** ... and they produce milk.

The dark-colored circle at the tip of the breast is called the **areola** */ah-REE-ah-lah/*. It contains sebaceous glands to keep the skin conditioned. In the center is the nipple, where ducts from the lobules open. The first secretion from the breast is not a true milk, but a thin yellowish substance called **colostrum**.

Colustrum contains nutrients and the mother's immunities that can protect baby.

## The Menstrual Cycle

The process of sloughing off the inner lining of the uterus, once monthly.

The onset of the menstrual cycle, or **menarche**, begins at puberty and ceases at **menopause**.

The cycle has 3 phases:
1. ### Follicular Phase
	- The follicular phase is characterized by menstruation, when the thickened lining of the endometrium is shed because no egg was fertilized or implanted.
2. Ovulatory Phase
3. Luteal Phase
