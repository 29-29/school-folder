#### **4th Quarter**

1. Written Work 1
2. Written Work 2
3. Written Work 3

### Explain what exactly you were required to do in these Written Works?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. We were asked to continue this phrase:

   > Critical Reading is ...

   in a short answer.

2. We looked at a table of data about early pregnancy and motherhood, and we were asked to reflect and give our findings based on the data. We wrote our output in paragraph form.
3. We listed down different types of questions based on the article we just read and the questions that came along with it. We did this activity with a group.
4. We picked out the sentences that didn't support the main topic, and those that support the main topic.
5. We underlined the sentences that were out of order or sequence to evaluate the paragraph's coherence. We did this activity with a partner.
6. We revised sentences that didn't feel right with cohesive devices, and we did it as a group.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this written work, we completed a paragraph and filled in supporting details to complete the idea.
2. In this written work, we made a graphic organizer with our select group mates, that was about a problem or a topic we chose.
3. In this written work, we made a proper review of a product. I chose to review Vim, which isn't really a product, but an open-source text editor.

### What information was the most interesting/surprising to you?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. I was amused by the concept of critical reading, because I was aware of it but I wasn't aware about it being a concept.
2. I was surprised to see that my expectations for the result weren't what they turned to be. I expected that the reckless teenagers would be more prone to early pregnancy, but it turned out that the 20-year-olds were more prone to pregnancy than the younger ages.
3. Questions can be put into different classifications, and with that, you have an idea on how to efficiently answer the questions.
4. Reading a paragraph without unity feels weird. The bits of the paragraph that don’t really point to the main idea distract the reader and causes them to lose grip of the main idea.
5. My reaction to this was pretty much the same with the last activity, but this time, we get the satisfaction of revising the wronged paragraph using cohesive devices.
6. Sentences can be easily fixed with just simple words such as “because”, and you can make the sentence be read smoothly without any doubt in it.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. I learned in this written work, that with proper research, and sequence of ideas, a single sentence’s idea can be completed with the supporting details that’ll come after it.
2. I learned and solidified the fact for myself that two heads are better than one, because me and my group mates came up with a lot of ideas, and even ideas that I myself couldn’t think of.
3. It was fun to review a product that I really like and use, and maybe a bit of bias was mixed into the critique, but anyway, it was a fun activity.

### Which of the Written Works you did well? Why?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I’d say I have done well in much of the tasks given to us, despite missing the first day of classes. Because I participated, took my time, and kept up with the activities as much as possible.

#### **4th Quarter**

I did well with all the activities. Because I was able to catch up.

### In what Written Work do you need to improve? How?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I want to work on my motivation to read long passages. I have very bad attentiveness and I get hooked by my environment quickly. I need to work on focusing in class and focusing on what I’m doing.

#### **4th Quarter**

The only thing I have to work on is the punctuality.

## Performance Tasks

### What are the Performance Tasks?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. Mini Performance Task 1: Revising through Cohesion
2. Mini Performance Task 2: Comparing & Contrasting

#### **4th Quarter**

1. Mini Performance Task 1
2. Mini Performance Task 2
3. Mini Performance Task 2 Part 2

### Explain exactly what you were required to do in this Performance Task?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. We were told to revise a paragraph using cohesive devices.
2. We were asked to compare and contrast two subjects in an essay form.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this mini performance task, we wrote a position paper. I chose the topic “Online Learning” having a stand against normalizing it.
2. In this mini performance task, we made a resume.
3. In this mini performance task, we made scholarship application letter, basing the details off the resume we made in the last mini performance task.

### How may the skills that you have developed in this Performance Task be of help to you in your future career?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. Cohesive devices are very useful when revising sentences and making the ideas flow smoothly as the reader reads it.
2. Having different ways to compare two topics is very handy, especially having two ways expressing your thoughts.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. Position papers are like the scripts for asynchronous debates for me. I learned in this activity how to express my stand and opinions on topics in a more formal manner.
2. Resumes are key items in the hustle for finding jobs, which is what we will get into hopefully after or during college.
3. Learning how to write a scholarship application letter is going to be very helpful, to me and my family. Because I am looking forward to applying for a scholarship when I come home to the Philippines for college.

### Which of the Performance Tasks you did well in? Why?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I’d rather lean towards doing well in the first mini peta. Because I clearly understood the topic well among the others. I also did well in mini peta 2, because I had a good understanding of the activity and the topic.

#### **4th Quarter**

I did well in all as well, because I was in pace with the lessons.

### In what Performance Task do you need to improve? How?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I’d gladly say I did well with most of the activities, it’s just that I feel like I was a bit tight on time, so I need to be more punctual.

#### **4th Quarter**

I need to improve in being more comprehensive in most of my writings, because I lack details, explanation and reason when I write out my ideas.

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. We were asked two simple questions about sports, its rules, and how it benefited us in any way.
2. We filled in tables about athletic sports, a topic we recently just studied. We also assessed our knowledge of the said topic through defining and explaining three words related to the topic.

1. Sports as a topic itself got me hooked to it. I look forward to the lessons.
2. I was very interested in how the professional athletes who play the game have so much stamina, I wish I had a talent like theirs.
3. When it comes to my main sport, lawn tennis, I’m not that much of a geek. But this made me feel like one. I also always thought that table tennis was the fastest paced racket game out there, until I realized how badminton is professionally played.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. Now that I think about it, the games we used to play as children were very competitive. I was and am of the people who were very small and nimble so I had some advantage in the games me and my friends used to play.
2. I got more familiar than I already was with the game of Basketball through this activity.
3. I also got more familiar about the game of Volleyball through this activity and lesson. I really enjoy watching and playing the game of volleyball.

### Which of the Written Works you did well? Why?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I would come to an agreement with myself that I have done well in all of the written works, since most of the required tasks were just revolving around the same topic we just have discussed.

#### **4th Quarter**

I’d say I did well in all the tasks given to us because I did my best in all of them, that is if I decide whether I did well or not.

### In what Written Work do you need to improve? How?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I do think that I don’t any much negative productivity this quarter, and I’m proud of that. I’m also proud to say I have to keep it up.

#### **4th Quarter**

So far, I didn’t any problems in the written works side of the tasks given to us, and I’d give myself a clap for achieving this this quarter. I would really love to continue this productivity next year, with all subjects as well.

1. Performance Task 1
2. Performance Task 2
3. Performance Task 3
4. Performance Task 4

### Explain exactly what you were required to do in this Performance Task?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. In this performance task, we provided ourselves a small ball, or any material in its shape in the case there isn’t a ball. Then we threw the ball in the air, clapped our hands, and caught the ball again. We had to do this 5 times for certain circumstances.
2. In this performance task, we measured the time it took for us to walk, and jog in different paces and variations.
3. In this performance task, we provided ourselves a racket and a ball, makeshifts if not available. We measured how much we could do forehands, and backhands, and measured the time it took for us as well.
4. In our final performance task, we watched a video of two professional badminton players going at it with each other. We were asked to reflect and give our insights on the clip of the match. We also gave our opinion on the subject in its course of 4 days.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this performance task, we used the house party app to play with our friends using the games built into the app.
2. In this performance task, we tried the different skills needed to play Sepak Takraw, and filled the data from our attempts into a table.
3. In this performance task, we played basketball with socks and clothes baskets. We also chugged the data from our runs into a table for the output.
4. In this performance task, we made a video that would demonstrate a certain skill in volleyball.

### How may the skills that you have developed in this Performance Task be of help to you in your future career?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. Hand-eye coordination is a serious thing in any field of competitive sports, and I think I just found a way to measure my hand-eye coordination with this activity.
2. Our legs are being used in our daily life indoor or outdoor, and since legs can be used in athletic professions, I think this can also be a measuring tool for when someone is planning on an athletic career.
3. As a lawn tennis player, I have been through this in my training stages, but I can still use this same technique for when I teach lawn tennis to younglings.
4. Game analysis are key factors when growing to be an iconic and strong athlete. Whether analysing your games, or analysing games of pros, it is always your advantage if you study where you went wrong, what you can do right, and etc.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. This activity was fun because we found new ways to recreate and entertain ourselves with friends. It’s not that me and my friends haven’t played since lock-down, but since the school year is coming to an end, we’re getting new ideas to try.
2. I was quite familiar with Sepak Takraw already, because I used to play Takyang, which is like sepak takraw but with something like a shuttlecock, when I was in Grade 6 in the Philippines. So this activity was fun to me as well, because I really enjoyed takyang in the Philippines.
3. I really like basketball, it’s just that I don’t have the enough stamina to play the game. This activity made me feel a bit better that have quite a decent shooting skill, with socks and baskets at least.
4. I really enjoyed this activity a lot, since I have also played and enjoyed volleyball in last year’s Intramurals. It gives me that flush of adrenaline and energy in a time like this pandemic.

### Which of the Performance Tasks you did well in? Why?

#### **3rd Quarter**

As with my response in the written works, I am proud to say I am content with my performance in all of the given tasks.

#### **4th Quarter**

I also did well in all of the performance tasks asked of us, and I hope I carry on this productivity as far as I can go.

### In what Performance Task do you need to improve? How?

#### **3rd Quarter**

And as I have previously mentioned, I am proud and satisfied with my products and in my opinion, there’s still room for improvement.

#### **4th Quarter**

I believe I have done my best and there’s nothing much to point out, aside from the fact that my punctuality in activities are inconsistent.

### Explain what exactly you were required to do in these Written Works?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. In this activity, we watched an hour-long tragedy movie concerning disaster readiness and awareness. Then we were asked to reflect on the events in the movie.
2. In this activity, we were split into breakout rooms. Then we picked out pictures that we could tell stories we could relate it to. Then in a Google Docs file, we picked out 3 images to explain the situation/disaster that occured to them.
3. In this activity, we sorted different kinds of hazards into 3 categories. Then we identified different words related to disaster readiness, hazards, and etc.
4. In this written work, we were grouped into breakout rooms. Each group was assigned a potential earthquake hazard. My group was assigned to Liquefaction or Soil Liquefaction. Later, our group’s assigned reporter explained and discussed our accumulated information to the class.
5. In this written work, we were given two hyperlinks to pages that contained information for a crossword we had to fill in.

#### **4th Quarter**

4. In this written work, we answered a Google Form about Rainfall-induced Landslides, and Sinkholes.
5. In this written work, we answered a Google Form about Human-induced hazards.
6. In this written work, we answered a Google Form about the DRR and CBDRM.

### What information was the most interesting/surprising to you?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. I’m quite surprised that although people have been taught disaster drills, especially students, almost all their lives, they still gave a number of casualties to the tornadoes.
2. I’ve come to realize that no matter what we do, disasters will always bring casualties to the table, and there’s no way around it. But what we do know is that we can prevent a larger and greater number of casualties and unfortunes.
3. Being able to classify different hazards is one step towards preventing/preparing for it. Learning about them thoroughly is an even larger one.
4. Now is the only time I learned about Soil Liquefaction, I never knew that the solid ground that I know can be as unstable as liquid water.
5. I was so interested in the different types of lava. I never learned about it until now.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. I have discovered in this written work about my correct hunches and misconceptions.
2. This was a very useful since the Philippines was a typhoon-prone country.
3. This topic was also a useful topic to learn since we have been hearing about the probabilities of ‘The Big One’ in the Philippines, which is what they expect to be a big earthquake.
4. I only learned about sinkholes in this lesson only, and never before. And I really was surprised by how deep (pun intended) the DRRR subject can get.
5. I realized how we can cause disasters ourselves to the communities that we ourselves live in.
6. I learned about the DRR and CBDRM in this lesson, which I never knew before.

### Which of the Written Works you did well? Why?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I’d like to point out that I appreciated the second activity a lot. Sharing stories and experiences with people help share the lessons we might have pulled out from it. And me having experienced some tragedies for myself, it’s nice to open it up to people.

#### **4th Quarter**

I had fun this quarter, which is probably the driving force for me to do a great job this quarter.

### In what Written Work do you need to improve? How?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I feel like I should’ve paid more attention to the movie we watched. That’s just the only doubt I have for myself this quarter.

#### **4th Quarter**

This time, I feel like I can do even more and even better, which is what I aim in the next year and in the coming subjects.

## Performance Tasks

### What are the Performance Tasks?

#### **3rd Quarter**

2. Mini Performance Task 2
3. Mini Performance Task 3
4. Mini Performance Task 4
5. Mini Performance Task 5

### Explain exactly what you were required to do in this Performance Task?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. In this performance task, we hopped on a flash animation. In the flash animation, we determined the most probable hazards in workspaces and everyday life as well, and dragged to it some possible solutions to them.
2. In this performance task, We hopped on another flash animation where tsunamis were elaborately explained. A couple or more video footage of tsunamis were included in the flash animation as well. Then we had to screenshot every page of the flash animation and put it in a Docs file.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this performance task, we answered a survey about our knowledge about the precautions before the strike of disasters.
2. In this performance task, we were grouped up to make a presentation about a topic given to us regarding the different types of disasters. Our group was particularly assigned the topic ‘Cyclones’. And we were asked to report about what we had come up after the breakout room session.
3. In this performance task, we played a management game about stopping disasters. The objectives of the game were more demanding as they wanted the player to prevent as much casualties and damages as possible, and to give the communities their specific needs, such as building schools, hospitals, or hotels.
4. In this performance task, we were grouped up again to make a presentation and report about an assigned topic to us. We were assigned the topic, ‘Sinkholes’.
5. In this performance task, we made an emergency survival plan for when disaster strikes our local communities in the Philippines.

### How may the skills that you have developed in this Performance Task be of help to you in your future career?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. One way or another, everyone is still going to be having a job. And when working, hazards will always be present, since we’re not in a perfect ideal world. Learning about these hazards and studying how we can avoid them as much as possible beforehand will be a great advantage for when we set foot into the world of labor.
2. I think being prepared for a tsunami beforehand is very helpful for when the real thing comes. Especially since the Philippines is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire where most seismic activities happen in the world.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. I learned in this performance task that I lack in a lot of stuff when the time of emergency comes, and it made me realize that I need to prepare myself even more, if I want to save, not only myself, but also others.
2. I learned about the different types of disasters in this activity, and I was able to distinguish a Typhoon from a Cyclone and from a Hurricane.
3. I enjoyed this activity as it brought out my competitive spirit. What’s interesting is I’m not competing with anyone, I was just trying to protect a ‘community’ from the devastating hands of nature and calamity.
4. I had time to understand the surroundings of our home in the Philippines through the help of my relatives in the Philippines. I was surprised about how I drew out the plan out of just details and the help of my family.

### Which of the Performance Tasks you did well in? Why?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I did well in all the performance tasks. They were all understandable and with the right motivation despite having the same class for a week straight.

#### **4th Quarter**

I did a good job this quarter, which I plan to expand into the incoming subjects and years.

### In what Performance Task do you need to improve? How?

#### **3rd Quarter**

So far, good progress, keep it up for next quarter.

#### **4th Quarter**

I don’t have a task to criticize this quarter, and I’m proud of that. Like I said, I plan to expand make this productivity reach the next subjects and years.
