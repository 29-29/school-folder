I am Ahmad Badron, and I may or may not consider myself an ambivert. And by that, I mean that I get very noisy with people I’ve known for long enough, and very silent around people I may know, but not too close to. I am a 5’7” (or 169 cm), 16 year old Filipino guy, born on a Tuesday, June 29, 2004 in Dammam Maternity Hospital, KSA. When I’ve got nothing to do, like nothing at all, I think about anything I can think of, and I brainstorm on it and come up with thoughts about the topic. So now you know about what goes in my head, when stationary. I’d say I am emotionally stable as a person. But kind of not too. I tend to overthink things, especially my friendships and relationships with people, which is a bad thing to do.

Currently, I am reading War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy, and I’m not sure if I’m ever gonna finish it. First of all because it has 2000+ pages, and second that matters is that I’m not that ‘reader’ -ish of a person. So I’m not sure how this read is gonna go. I have played Lawn Tennis ever since I was young enough to be able to carry a racket in both my hands. And I still play it to this day. I like a lot of challenges, and thinking, so I try programming challenges that help me make algorithms that are actually useful in the long run. Mention the fact I also program. So far, the languages I have learned and have been able to program on are C++, Python, JavaScript, and Java. HTML and CSS aren’t programming languages, mind you.

### Explain what exactly you were required to do in these Written Works?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. We were asked to continue this phrase:

   > Critical Reading is ...

   in a short answer.

2. We looked at a table of data about early pregnancy and motherhood, and we were asked to reflect and give our findings based on the data. We wrote our output in paragraph form.
3. We listed down different types of questions based on the article we just read and the questions that came along with it. We did this activity with a group.
4. We picked out the sentences that didn't support the main topic, and those that support the main topic.
5. We underlined the sentences that were out of order or sequence to evaluate the paragraph's coherence. We did this activity with a partner.
6. We revised sentences that didn't feel right with cohesive devices, and we did it as a group.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this written work, we completed a paragraph and filled in supporting details to complete the idea.
2. In this written work, we made a graphic organizer with our select group mates, that was about a problem or a topic we chose.
3. In this written work, we made a proper review of a product. I chose to review Vim, which isn't really a product, but an open-source text editor.

### What information was the most interesting/surprising to you?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. I was amused by the concept of critical reading, because I was aware of it but I wasn't aware about it being a concept.
2. I was surprised to see that my expectations for the result weren't what they turned to be. I expected that the reckless teenagers would be more prone to early pregnancy, but it turned out that the 20-year-olds were more prone to pregnancy than the younger ages.
3. Questions can be put into different classifications, and with that, you have an idea on how to efficiently answer the questions.
4. Reading a paragraph without unity feels weird. The bits of the paragraph that don’t really point to the main idea distract the reader and causes them to lose grip of the main idea.
5. My reaction to this was pretty much the same with the last activity, but this time, we get the satisfaction of revising the wronged paragraph using cohesive devices.
6. Sentences can be easily fixed with just simple words such as “because”, and you can make the sentence be read smoothly without any doubt in it.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. I learned in this written work, that with proper research, and sequence of ideas, a single sentence’s idea can be completed with the supporting details that’ll come after it.
2. I learned and solidified the fact for myself that two heads are better than one, because me and my group mates came up with a lot of ideas, and even ideas that I myself couldn’t think of.
3. It was fun to review a product that I really like and use, and maybe a bit of bias was mixed into the critique, but anyway, it was a fun activity.

### Which of the Written Works you did well? Why?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I’d say I have done well in much of the tasks given to us, despite missing the first day of classes. Because I participated, took my time, and kept up with the activities as much as possible.

#### **4th Quarter**

I did well with all the activities. Because I was able to catch up.

### In what Written Work do you need to improve? How?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I want to work on my motivation to read long passages. I have very bad attentiveness and I get hooked by my environment quickly. I need to work on focusing in class and focusing on what I’m doing.

#### **4th Quarter**

The only thing I have to work on is the punctuality.

## Performance Tasks

### What are the Performance Tasks?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. Mini Performance Task 1: Revising through Cohesion - `15/15`
2. Mini Performance Task 2: Comparing & Contrasting - `15/15`

#### **4th Quarter**

1. Mini Performance Task 1 - `?/25`

	![](https://github.com/29-29/school-portfolio-resources/blob/master/sy2021/11st2/rw/4q/rw-mpt1.png?raw=true)

2. Mini Performance Task 2 - `?/20`

	![](https://github.com/29-29/school-portfolio-resources/blob/master/sy2021/11st2/rw/4q/rw-mpt2.png?raw=true)

	![](https://github.com/29-29/school-portfolio-resources/blob/master/sy2021/11st2/rw/4q/rw-mpt3.png?raw=true)

### Explain exactly what you were required to do in this Performance Task?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. We were told to revise a paragraph using cohesive devices.
2. We were asked to compare and contrast two subjects in an essay form.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this mini performance task, we wrote a position paper. I chose the topic “Online Learning” having a stand against normalizing it.
2. In this mini performance task, we made a resume.
3. In this mini performance task, we made scholarship application letter, basing the details off the resume we made in the last mini performance task.

### How may the skills that you have developed in this Performance Task be of help to you in your future career?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. Cohesive devices are very useful when revising sentences and making the ideas flow smoothly as the reader reads it.
2. Having different ways to compare two topics is very handy, especially having two ways expressing your thoughts.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. Position papers are like the scripts for asynchronous debates for me. I learned in this activity how to express my stand and opinions on topics in a more formal manner.
2. Resumes are key items in the hustle for finding jobs, which is what we will get into hopefully after or during college.
3. Learning how to write a scholarship application letter is going to be very helpful, to me and my family. Because I am looking forward to applying for a scholarship when I come home to the Philippines for college.

### Which of the Performance Tasks you did well in? Why?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I’d rather lean towards doing well in the first mini peta. Because I clearly understood the topic well among the others. I also did well in mini peta 2, because I had a good understanding of the activity and the topic.

#### **4th Quarter**

I did well in all as well, because I was in pace with the lessons.

### In what Performance Task do you need to improve? How?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I’d gladly say I did well with most of the activities, it’s just that I feel like I was a bit tight on time, so I need to be more punctual.

#### **4th Quarter**

I need to improve in being more comprehensive in most of my writings, because I lack details, explanation and reason when I write out my ideas.

	![](https://github.com/29-29/school-portfolio-resources/blob/master/sy2021/11st2/pe/4q/pe-ww3.png?raw=true)

### Explain what exactly you were required to do in these Written Works?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. We were asked two simple questions about sports, its rules, and how it benefited us in any way.
2. We filled in tables about athletic sports, a topic we recently just studied. We also assessed our knowledge of the said topic through defining and explaining three words related to the topic.
3. We filled in tables about the respective racket games we studied about. We were also asked to describe Pickleball and where it originated.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this written work, we shared our experiences about traditional games we played as children.
2. In this written work, we answered fill-in-the-blanks questions about Basketball and some identification about the Basketball court.
3. In this written work, we did the same thing last task, but about Volleyball this time.

### What information was the most interesting/surprising to you?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. Sports as a topic itself got me hooked to it. I look forward to the lessons.
2. I was very interested in how the professional athletes who play the game have so much stamina, I wish I had a talent like theirs.
3. When it comes to my main sport, lawn tennis, I’m not that much of a geek. But this made me feel like one. I also always thought that table tennis was the fastest paced racket game out there, until I realized how badminton is professionally played.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. Now that I think about it, the games we used to play as children were very competitive. I was and am of the people who were very small and nimble so I had some advantage in the games me and my friends used to play.
2. I got more familiar than I already was with the game of Basketball through this activity.
3. I also got more familiar about the game of Volleyball through this activity and lesson. I really enjoy watching and playing the game of volleyball.

### Which of the Written Works you did well? Why?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I would come to an agreement with myself that I have done well in all of the written works, since most of the required tasks were just revolving around the same topic we just have discussed.

#### **4th Quarter**

I’d say I did well in all the tasks given to us because I did my best in all of them, that is if I decide whether I did well or not.

### In what Written Work do you need to improve? How?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I do think that I don’t any much negative productivity this quarter, and I’m proud of that. I’m also proud to say I have to keep it up.

#### **4th Quarter**

So far, I didn’t any problems in the written works side of the tasks given to us, and I’d give myself a clap for achieving this this quarter. I would really love to continue this productivity next year, with all subjects as well.

4. Performance Task 4 - `?/30`

### Explain exactly what you were required to do in this Performance Task?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. In this performance task, we provided ourselves a small ball, or any material in its shape in the case there isn’t a ball. Then we threw the ball in the air, clapped our hands, and caught the ball again. We had to do this 5 times for certain circumstances.
2. In this performance task, we measured the time it took for us to walk, and jog in different paces and variations.
3. In this performance task, we provided ourselves a racket and a ball, makeshifts if not available. We measured how much we could do forehands, and backhands, and measured the time it took for us as well.
4. In our final performance task, we watched a video of two professional badminton players going at it with each other. We were asked to reflect and give our insights on the clip of the match. We also gave our opinion on the subject in its course of 4 days.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this performance task, we used the house party app to play with our friends using the games built into the app.
2. In this performance task, we tried the different skills needed to play Sepak Takraw, and filled the data from our attempts into a table.
3. In this performance task, we played basketball with socks and clothes baskets. We also chugged the data from our runs into a table for the output.
4. In this performance task, we made a video that would demonstrate a certain skill in volleyball.

### How may the skills that you have developed in this Performance Task be of help to you in your future career?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. Hand-eye coordination is a serious thing in any field of competitive sports, and I think I just found a way to measure my hand-eye coordination with this activity.
2. Our legs are being used in our daily life indoor or outdoor, and since legs can be used in athletic professions, I think this can also be a measuring tool for when someone is planning on an athletic career.
3. As a lawn tennis player, I have been through this in my training stages, but I can still use this same technique for when I teach lawn tennis to younglings.
4. Game analysis are key factors when growing to be an iconic and strong athlete. Whether analysing your games, or analysing games of pros, it is always your advantage if you study where you went wrong, what you can do right, and etc.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. This activity was fun because we found new ways to recreate and entertain ourselves with friends. It’s not that me and my friends haven’t played since lock-down, but since the school year is coming to an end, we’re getting new ideas to try.
2. I was quite familiar with Sepak Takraw already, because I used to play Takyang, which is like sepak takraw but with something like a shuttlecock, when I was in Grade 6 in the Philippines. So this activity was fun to me as well, because I really enjoyed takyang in the Philippines.
3. I really like basketball, it’s just that I don’t have the enough stamina to play the game. This activity made me feel a bit better that have quite a decent shooting skill, with socks and baskets at least.
4. I really enjoyed this activity a lot, since I have also played and enjoyed volleyball in last year’s Intramurals. It gives me that flush of adrenaline and energy in a time like this pandemic.

### Which of the Performance Tasks you did well in? Why?

#### **3rd Quarter**

As with my response in the written works, I am proud to say I am content with my performance in all of the given tasks.

#### **4th Quarter**

I also did well in all of the performance tasks asked of us, and I hope I carry on this productivity as far as I can go.

### In what Performance Task do you need to improve? How?

#### **3rd Quarter**

And as I have previously mentioned, I am proud and satisfied with my products and in my opinion, there’s still room for improvement.

#### **4th Quarter**

I believe I have done my best and there’s nothing much to point out, aside from the fact that my punctuality in activities are inconsistent.

	![](https://github.com/29-29/school-portfolio-resources/blob/master/sy2021/11st2/dr/4q/dr-ww6.png?raw=true)

### Explain what exactly you were required to do in these Written Works?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. In this activity, we watched an hour-long tragedy movie concerning disaster readiness and awareness. Then we were asked to reflect on the events in the movie.
2. In this activity, we were split into breakout rooms. Then we picked out pictures that we could tell stories we could relate it to. Then in a Google Docs file, we picked out 3 images to explain the situation/disaster that occured to them.
3. In this activity, we sorted different kinds of hazards into 3 categories. Then we identified different words related to disaster readiness, hazards, and etc.
4. In this written work, we were grouped into breakout rooms. Each group was assigned a potential earthquake hazard. My group was assigned to Liquefaction or Soil Liquefaction. Later, our group’s assigned reporter explained and discussed our accumulated information to the class.
5. In this written work, we were given two hyperlinks to pages that contained information for a crossword we had to fill in.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this written work, we did a pre-unit activity in Page 70-71 of the book.
2. In this written work, we answered a Google Form about Hydro meteorological Hazards.
3. In this written work, we answered a Google Form about Geological Hazards.
4. In this written work, we answered a Google Form about Rainfall-induced Landslides, and Sinkholes.
5. In this written work, we answered a Google Form about Human-induced hazards.
6. In this written work, we answered a Google Form about the DRR and CBDRM.

### What information was the most interesting/surprising to you?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. I’m quite surprised that although people have been taught disaster drills, especially students, almost all their lives, they still gave a number of casualties to the tornadoes.
2. I’ve come to realize that no matter what we do, disasters will always bring casualties to the table, and there’s no way around it. But what we do know is that we can prevent a larger and greater number of casualties and unfortunes.
3. Being able to classify different hazards is one step towards preventing/preparing for it. Learning about them thoroughly is an even larger one.
4. Now is the only time I learned about Soil Liquefaction, I never knew that the solid ground that I know can be as unstable as liquid water.
5. I was so interested in the different types of lava. I never learned about it until now.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. I have discovered in this written work about my correct hunches and misconceptions.
2. This was a very useful since the Philippines was a typhoon-prone country.
3. This topic was also a useful topic to learn since we have been hearing about the probabilities of ‘The Big One’ in the Philippines, which is what they expect to be a big earthquake.
4. I only learned about sinkholes in this lesson only, and never before. And I really was surprised by how deep (pun intended) the DRRR subject can get.
5. I realized how we can cause disasters ourselves to the communities that we ourselves live in.
6. I learned about the DRR and CBDRM in this lesson, which I never knew before.

### Which of the Written Works you did well? Why?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I’d like to point out that I appreciated the second activity a lot. Sharing stories and experiences with people help share the lessons we might have pulled out from it. And me having experienced some tragedies for myself, it’s nice to open it up to people.

#### **4th Quarter**

I had fun this quarter, which is probably the driving force for me to do a great job this quarter.

### In what Written Work do you need to improve? How?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I feel like I should’ve paid more attention to the movie we watched. That’s just the only doubt I have for myself this quarter.

#### **4th Quarter**

This time, I feel like I can do even more and even better, which is what I aim in the next year and in the coming subjects.

## Performance Tasks

### Explain exactly what you were required to do in this Performance Task?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. In this performance task, we hopped on a flash animation. In the flash animation, we determined the most probable hazards in workspaces and everyday life as well, and dragged to it some possible solutions to them.
2. In this performance task, We hopped on another flash animation where tsunamis were elaborately explained. A couple or more video footage of tsunamis were included in the flash animation as well. Then we had to screenshot every page of the flash animation and put it in a Docs file.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this performance task, we answered a survey about our knowledge about the precautions before the strike of disasters.
2. In this performance task, we were grouped up to make a presentation about a topic given to us regarding the different types of disasters. Our group was particularly assigned the topic ‘Cyclones’. And we were asked to report about what we had come up after the breakout room session.
3. In this performance task, we played a management game about stopping disasters. The objectives of the game were more demanding as they wanted the player to prevent as much casualties and damages as possible, and to give the communities their specific needs, such as building schools, hospitals, or hotels.
4. In this performance task, we were grouped up again to make a presentation and report about an assigned topic to us. We were assigned the topic, ‘Sinkholes’.
5. In this performance task, we made an emergency survival plan for when disaster strikes our local communities in the Philippines.

### How may the skills that you have developed in this Performance Task be of help to you in your future career?

#### **3rd Quarter**

1. One way or another, everyone is still going to be having a job. And when working, hazards will always be present, since we’re not in a perfect ideal world. Learning about these hazards and studying how we can avoid them as much as possible beforehand will be a great advantage for when we set foot into the world of labor.
2. I think being prepared for a tsunami beforehand is very helpful for when the real thing comes. Especially since the Philippines is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire where most seismic activities happen in the world.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. I learned in this performance task that I lack in a lot of stuff when the time of emergency comes, and it made me realize that I need to prepare myself even more, if I want to save, not only myself, but also others.
2. I learned about the different types of disasters in this activity, and I was able to distinguish a Typhoon from a Cyclone and from a Hurricane.
3. I enjoyed this activity as it brought out my competitive spirit. What’s interesting is I’m not competing with anyone, I was just trying to protect a ‘community’ from the devastating hands of nature and calamity.
4. I had time to understand the surroundings of our home in the Philippines through the help of my relatives in the Philippines. I was surprised about how I drew out the plan out of just details and the help of my family.

### Which of the Performance Tasks you did well in? Why?

#### **3rd Quarter**

I did well in all the performance tasks. They were all understandable and with the right motivation despite having the same class for a week straight.

#### **4th Quarter**

I did a good job this quarter, which I plan to expand into the incoming subjects and years.

### In what Performance Task do you need to improve? How?

#### **3rd Quarter**

So far, good progress, keep it up for next quarter.

#### **4th Quarter**

I don’t have a task to criticize this quarter, and I’m proud of that. Like I said, I plan to expand make this productivity reach the next subjects and years.

I believe that I did an excellent job on Written Work 6, because I had the help of my classmates and, in turn, helped my classmates with this activity.

#### **4th Quarter**

I believe I did an excellent job in all the written works. Which I would applaud myself for, except for some stuff.

### In what Written Work do you need to improve? How?
#### **3rd Quarter**

I didn’t perform well enough in Written Work 3, probably because I didn’t review what I just learned thoroughly. I should though next time.

#### **4th Quarter**

The *some stuff* I was referring to in the previous question was my punctuality in the last few tasks. Although I was very confident that I would submit my tasks on or , more importantly, before time. This is just a little pebble that I might've tripped on on the way to being an excellent student.

## Performance Tasks
### What are the Performance Tasks?
#### **3rd Quarter**

I believe I did well in all the MPTs and that there isn’t anything more to answer to this question.

#### **4th Quarter**

A problem I again face is punctuality, which I'd say I did well most of the time, but not this time. I have to work on that.

### Explain what exactly you were required to do in these Written Works?
#### **3rd Quarter**

1. In this written work, we answered a set of 3 questions that asked us about
2. In this written work, we filled in a table with the data it needed: a research article for the specified the field, and it had to be a qualitative study. We had to figure out its type of qualitative research, and its research approach.
3. In this written work, we continued with the same topic as the last written work, and we made the statement of the problem, along with the beneficiary of the research project.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this written work, we composed a part of our hypothetical research, which is the review of related literature and studies.
2. In this written work, we made another output for hypothetical research. This time, about research design and sampling populations.
3. In this written work, we made another output for the same hypothetical research. The topic this time was about the methodology of gathering the data from our samples.
4. In this written work, we wrote paper about the type of data analysis we would use on our hypothetical research.

### What information was the most interesting/surprising to you?
#### **3rd Quarter**

1. This written work made me realize the importance and value of research, and it sparked my interest in researching different kinds of stuff.
2. I learned that studies in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, don’t necessarily need to be quantitative studies. There are various types of qualitative studies in the said fields that are really unexpected when you first think of these fields.
3. I always thought research papers are just made to be put out on the internet or something, but now I learned that research projects are directed towards the community, and it is put out there for a reason, which is to solve a problem, at the least.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. I learned to understand more than just to read what I was reading, which is very essential as to not read a passage over and over again, just to understand the passage.
2. I learned about different methods of determining the sample size for your research, although I used Universal Sampling since it was suggested to me, and it also made sense to do so.
3. I learned how to ACTUALLY prepare for an interview. I also learned that interviews aren't made for entertainment, but for the pursuit of knowledge as well.
4. I learned how to organize the data that you gather after acquiring them, that is through categorizing everything, and sub-categorizing its details to further abstract the organization of data, for ease of analyzing it.

### Which of the Written Works you did well? Why?
#### **3rd Quarter**

I’m saying this unconfidently, but I’m just confident with how I did in Task 1. Just because I actually got a handle of what was happening in the written work.

#### **4th Quarter**

I'm quite proud with what I achieved this semester and I'm happy to say so as well. I believe that I did so because of the sufficient motivation that Sir Herbert gave us while we were under the process of making these tasks.

### In what Written Work do you need to improve? How?
#### **3rd Quarter**

I don’t have a written work in my mind that I did that bad on. But the closest written work to that bad is Task 4, in my opinion. Not just because of my punctuality, but also because of how I did in it.

#### **4th Quarter**

As I have said, there's not much negativity to find in my output this quarter. And that is something I strive to see next year as well.

## Performance Tasks
### What are the Performance Tasks?

### Explain exactly what you were required to do in this Performance Task?
#### **3rd Quarter**

1. In this performance task, ironically, we applied what we learned from the discussion and we chose a topic to make a project proposal, the main question, and the specific questions for the research topic.
2. In this performance task, we drew out the IPO model for the same research topic we’ve been holding in Task 3 & 4. We also determined the scope and limitations for the study.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this performance task, we determined the research instrument to use for our hypothetical research.

### How may the skills that you have developed in this Performance Task be of help to you in your future career?
#### **3rd Quarter**

1. I think I will only be able to use these skills in college when thesis stuff come in, but it’s still useful I guess.
2. The skills I may acquire from this performance task will be useful, like I said before, in thesis and research in college or the coming years.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. It is fairly obvious that the skills I will acquire in this performance task can help me in my studies when my curiosity dominates my procrastination.

### Which of the Performance Tasks you did well in? Why?
#### **3rd Quarter**

I can only admit that I did well in Task 3. There’s no real reason to perform well, I just did a great job. I’m also hopeful.

#### **4th Quarter**

It's sad to say that I'm leaving the 'Practice' stage of practical research, to enter the 'Practical' research stage. I gave it my all. And as they say, give and take.

### In what Performance Task do you need to improve? How?
#### **3rd Quarter**

Not much, I’m happy with my results. But there’s still room for growth and improvement, which will be in use in the next school quarter and years.

### Explain what exactly you were required to do in these Written Works?
#### **3rd Quarter**

1. In this written work, we were asked to sketch the graphs of the sine and cosine function. We had to find the amplitude, period, and the 5 key points before we were able to sketch the graph in detail.
2. In this written work, we were asked to sketch the graphs of the inverse of the sine and cosine function, the cosecant and secant respectively. We had to sketch the graph of the sine or cosine of the given problem and then we just had to invert the graph.
3. In this quiz, we were asked to find the necessary points needed to sketch the graph of a given trigonometric function, then we sketched the graph of the given function. We were given 3 of these problems to solve.
4. In this written work, we verified the identities of the given trigonometric functions. We needed to make the statement obvious enough to be true. This was achieved through various algebraic operations that were studied in the past, and with the knowledge of the trigonometric identities.
5. In this written work, we had a quick seatwork on our recent topic, limits of functions. We were given 8 problems that we had to evaluate and find the limitations of.
6. In this written work, we were given problems, related to left and right hand limits, or better known as one sided limits, one of which is in the exercise set in the Basic Calculus book and another given by ma’am Ilas.
7. In this written work, we were tested to find the limits of rational functions which had infinite limits, and we had to prove it analytically and graphically.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this written work, we answered a set of problems that Ma'am Thelma gave us. The problems were about finding the limits of equations as the limit approached infinity.
2. In this written work, we answered a set of problems from page 111-13 of the textbook. It was about differentiating equations and getting their derivatives.
3. In this written work, we were given problems to solve for each of the following topics: higher order derivatives, implicit differentiation, and optimum/optimization.

### What information was the most interesting/surprising to you?
#### **3rd Quarter**

1. I’m pretty aware of basic trigonometric functions and their graphs, but I was very interested in learning more about it, which this lesson really helped me to. I will enjoy this lesson.
2. Inverses of trigonometric functions are way more complicated, and I still feel like there’s more to know on how these functions work, because if sines and cosines go wavy, these inverted trigo functions go the other way.
3. This quiz solidified our knowledge and understanding on the concept of and graphing trigonometric functions.
4. It’s surprising how this trigonometric constants just loop back to each other. These concepts are very unique in the field of mathematics to me, the logics and the stars just line up perfectly, as the trigonometric identities do so too.
5. Finding the limits of functions are fairly easy when we’re talking about linear functions here. 
6. I was very amazed by the mechanics of limits and how they work, it gets me interested in how and where they really shine the brightest.
7. This was like a plot twist. Just when you thought that limits can also not exist, then you also learn that there can be infinite limits! What are the limits to Math’s wonders?

#### **4th Quarter**

1. I learned about new properties in finding limits of equations. That is about limits at infinity. Infinity is an odd value in the realm of mathematics. It kind of fits in, but when you look deeper into it, it seems it doesn't belong here.
2. I got my first step towards differential equations which has been an interesting topic to me always.
3. These topics were like an expansion DLC to the base differential equations game.

### Which of the Written Works you did well? Why?
#### **3rd Quarter**

I’m proud to say that I did well in all works, but what I’m not proud of is how I only am confident in this subject.

#### **4th Quarter**

With the quarter, semester, and school year over for this subject, I'm happy to say I did my best in all the tasks as much as I could. And I would too in the next school year.

### In what Written Work do you need to improve? How?
#### **3rd Quarter**

There was a lot of confusion in Activity 3.6, which I need to improve on by practicing with problems like these.

#### **4th Quarter**

With proper review and studying on the topics, I was able to make minimum mistakes which is to say that everyone makes mistakes.

	![](https://github.com/29-29/school-portfolio-resources/blob/master/sy2021/11st2/bc/4q/bc-peta0.png?raw=true)

### Explain exactly what you were required to do in this Performance Task?
#### **3rd Quarter**

1. In this mini task, we were grouped into a breakout room. We had to simplify given trigonometric functions.
2. In this mini task, we were grouped into a breakout room in random, and we were asked to simplify a given function to be able to have a valid limit out of the function.
3. In this PeTa, we did a Google Form on trigonometric functions and then we had to solve problems about limits, piecewise functions, and etc. on paper.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this mini task, we were grouped into a breakout room, this time not in random. And we looked into problems about limits of trigo functions.
2. In this mini task, we were grouped into breakout rooms again, and we kind of sticked to the same team, plus Caryll since she was usually alone (afaik). This time, we solved problems about derivatives of functions, right after we learned some basic differentiating.
3. In this PeTa, we answered a marathon of problems on the book regarding finding the derivatives of functions.

### How may the skills that you have developed in this Performance Task be of help to you in your future career?
#### **3rd Quarter**

1. I still can’t clearly see where limits are going to be useful in my future career, but all I know for now is it will.
2. The future is fogged and I can’t see where this skill will take me. But it is being taught to us for a reason, so why not?
3. As foggy as it was on Friday, where specifically I can use these skills I can’t determine. But it will come in handy at some point if not in the nearer future.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. I think that cooperation of every member is key in groupworks, and being a fair contributor to the group is what I found useful in this activity.
2. I have watched quite the videos on where differential equations can be used and applied to (such as fluid simulations), and I'm excited to try them out myself.
3. Patience and perseverance was a value that I picked up in this activity since you really needed it to make it through the pile of schoolworks about Math.

### Which of the Performance Tasks you did well in? Why?
#### **3rd Quarter**

For the most part, I did well in all, there was just some incosistency, but so far, so good.

#### **4th Quarter**

I have done well in all the performance tasks this quarter, and I am quite impressed of myself myself.

### In what Performance Task do you need to improve? How?
#### **3rd Quarter**

One thing I didn’t do well in these performance tasks was my punctuality, and proficiency in the topics especially in the final PeTa. So I have to work on finishing my work earlier, and more accurately.

#### **4th Quarter**

I have no comment on this since I don't see any aspect of my productivity I can criticize this quarter.

### Explain what exactly you were required to do in these Written Works?
#### **3rd Quarter**

1. In this written work, we did an ‘Extension’ activity in page 9 of the book. We had to fill out a table of the different possibilities for what balls you can draw out of the box.
2. In this written work, we filled out answers to questions in page 17-18 of the book.
3. In this written work, we answered some problems given to us by Ma’am Shaima about standard scores, and the standard normal table.
4. In this written work, we solved problems about standard scores but in more English sense.
5. In this written work, we answered problems about finding the mean, and standard deviation of sampling distribution of the sample means.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. In this written work, we answered 15 problems about hypothesis testing. We had to determine its null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, and whether it was directional or non-directional.
2. In this written work, we answered 10 problems about finding the critical value. We had to determine the critical value, and if it was positive or negative.
3. In this written work, we were given 5 problems. We had to distinguish the independent from the dependent variable.
4. In this written work, we were given 3 problems to find the value of r and make an interpretation of the correlation of the variables.

### What information was the most interesting/surprising to you?
#### **3rd Quarter**

1. I was fairly familiar with combinations and sequences before, so it was fun to revisit this topic in another light.
2. Discrete probability distribution is a new concept I learned and it is a very interesting concept, I’m gonna be honest.
3. This activity was a bomb of questions and problems. It was fun to answer them all, one by one.
4. This activity was also a good activity practice my skills in solving.
5. This was, in all honesty, a bit of a heavy work, but I carried through, and we carried through. This activity helped me crank up my motivation standard.

#### **4th Quarter**

1. I learned about the two types of hypothesis, and I was surprised that the court analogy worked so well in this case.
2. Today, I learned about critical values, and how to determine whether to reject a null hypothesis or not.
3. I was already familiar with the topic of variables since it is quite the block needed in programming.
4. I learned about the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, which is quite a long name, tbh. Which can tell you what the scatter plot might look like, which is very interesting. I want to learn more on how a specific formula can do that.

### Which of the Written Works you did well? Why?
