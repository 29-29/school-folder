## DNA Helicase
- unwinds and separates double stranded DNA as it moves along the DNA.
- forms the replication fork by breaking hydrogen bonds between nucleotide pairs in DNA.

## DNA Primase
- type of RNA polymerase that generates RNA primers.
- short RNA molecules that act as templates for the starting point of DNA replication.

## DNA Polymerase
- synthesize new DNA molecules by adding nucleotides to leading and lagging DNA strands.

## Topoisomerase or DNA Gyrase
- unwinds and rewinds DNA strands to prevent the DNA from becoming tangled or supercoiled.
