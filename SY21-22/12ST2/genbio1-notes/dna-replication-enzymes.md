# DNA Replication Enzymes
December 2, 5 2021

---

### DNA Helicase
- unwinds and separates double stranded DNA as it moves along the DNA.
- forms the replication fork by breaking hydrogen bonds between nucleotide pairs in DNA.

### DNA Primase
- type of RNA polymerase that generates RNA primers.
- short RNA molecules that act as templates for the starting point of DNA replication.

### DNA Polymerase
- synthesize new DNA molecules by adding nucleotides to leading and lagging DNA strands.

---

### Topoisomerase or DNA Gyrase
- unwinds and rewinds DNA strands to prevent the DNA from becoming tangled or supercoiled.

### Exonucleus
- group of enzymes that remove nucleotide bases from the end of a DNA chain.

### DNA Ligase
- joins DNA fragments together by forming phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides.

## STEPS in DNA REPLICATION
- unzipping the double helix structure of the DNA molecule.
- the separation of the two single strands of DNA creates a 'Y' shape called a **replication fork**.
- the two separated strands will act as templates for making the new strand of DNA.
- one of the strands is oriented in the **3'** (pronounced '3 prime') **to 5' direction** (towards the replication fork), this is the **leading strand**.
- the other strand is oriented in the **5' to 3' direction** (away from the replication fork), this is the **lagging strand**.

---

## LEADING STRAND
- a short piece of RNA called a primer (produced by an enzyme called **primase**) comes along and binds to the end of the leading strand.
- the primer acts as the starting point for DNA synthesis.
- DNA polymerase binds to the leading strand and then 'walks' along it, adding new complementary nucleotide bases (A, C, G, and T) to the strand of DNA in the 5' to 3' direction.
- this sort of replication is called continuous.

---

## LAGGING STRAND
- numerous RNA primers are made by the primase enzyme and bind at various points along the lagging strand.
- chunks of DNA called **Okazaki fragments**, are then added to the lagging strand also in the 5' to 3' direction.
- this type of replication is called discontinuous as the Okazaki fragments will need to be joined up later.

---

## STEPS in DNA REPLICATION

- once all of the bases are matched up (A with T, c with G), an enzyme called **exonuclease** strips away the primer(s). The gaps where the primer(s) were are then filled by yet more complementary nucleotides.
- finally, an enzyme called DNA ligase seals up the sequence of DNA into two continuous double strands.
- the result of DNA replication is two DNA molecules consisting of one new and one old chain of nucleotides.

## Codon
- a sequence of three nucleotides that corresponds with a specific amino acid or start/stop signal during translation

## Transcription
- process during which a DNA sequence of a gene is copied to make an RNA molecule

## Translation
- process during which an mRNA molecule is used to assemble amino acids into polypeptide proteins

## Polypeptide
- a chain of amino acids

---

## RNA Structure
- the building blocks of RNA are nucleotides, just like DNA.
- A nucleotide in RNA is still made of 3 important things:
	1. 5-carbon sugar - **ribose** (instead of deoxyribose)
	2. [...]

## THREE Main Types of RNA
1. **Messenger RNA** (mRNA)
	- carries copies of instructions for the assembly of amino acids into proteins from DNA to the rest of the cell (serve as "messenger").

## THREE Main Types of RNA
2. **Ribosomal RNA** (rRNA)
	- makes up the major part of ribosomes [...]

3. Transfer NRA (tRNA)
